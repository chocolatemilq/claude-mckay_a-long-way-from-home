			<h2>XX</h2>
			<h2>Regarding Radical Criticism</h2>
			<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Thus</span> ended my adventure in Russia. This detailed account should clear up any "mystery" that is entertained about my going and remaining there. I left Russia with one determination and one objective: to write. I was not received in Russia as a politician, but primarily as a Negro poet. And the tremendous reception was a great inspiration and urge to write more. I often felt in Russia that I was honored as a poet altogether out of proportion to my actual performance. And thus I was fired with the desire to accomplish the utmost.</p>
			<p>Excepting for the handicap of lack of money, there was nothing to side-track me from my purpose. I had no radical party affiliations, and there was no reason why I should consider myself under any special obligations to the Communists. I had not committed myself to anything. I had remained a free agent.</p>
			<p>But recently in an issue of <i>The New Masses</i>, the literary organ of the American Communists, I was singled out for a special attack in an article about Negro novelists. The article, under the guise of a critique, was merely a piece of personal spite and slander.</p>
			<p>I take these extracts from that article: (1) I had "written an indignant poem, attacking lynching, wholly lacking in working-class content." (2) I "disappeared mysteriously to the Soviet Union and had retired exhausted to the sidewalk cafés<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> of Montmartre." (3) "The retired radical had grown fat and ill and indifferent in Paris."</p>
			<p>Against the Communist attack my poem still remains my strong defense:</p>
			<p>
				<i>IF WE MUST DIE</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If we must die, let it not be like hogs</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Making their mock at our accursed lot.</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If we must die, Oh let us nobly die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So that our precious blood may not be shed</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In vain; then even the monsters we defy</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh, kinsmen! we must meet the common foe!</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Though far outnumbered let us show us brave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What though before us lies the open grave?</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Like men we'll face the murderous cowardly pack,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!</span>
					<br/>
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>First published in Max Eastman's magazine <i>The Liberator</i>, the poem was reprinted in every Negro publication of any consequence. It forced its way into the Negro pulpit (a most interesting phenomenon for this black heretic). Ministers ended their sermons with it, and the congregations responded, Amen. It was repeated in Negro clubs and Negro schools and at Negro mass meetings. To thousands of Negroes who are not trained to appreciate poetry, "If We Must Die" makes me a poet. I myself was amazed at the general sentiment for the poem. For I am so intensely subjective as a poet, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> I was not aware, at the moment of writing, that I was transformed into a medium to express a mass sentiment.</p>
			<p>The critic also asserted that my novel, <i>Home to Harlem</i>, had no "class-conscious action." When Jake in <i>Home to Harlem</i> refused to scab, wasn't that class-conscious? And when he refused to pimp, didn't he demonstrate a high sense of social propriety? Perhaps a higher sense than many of us critical scribblers.</p>
			<p>I did not come to the knowing of Negro workers in an academic way, by talking to black crowds at meetings, nor in a bohemian way, by talking about them in cafés. I knew the unskilled Negro worker of the city by working with him as a porter and longshoreman and as waiter on the railroad. I lived in the same quarters and we drank and caroused together in bars and at rent parties. So when I came to write about the low-down Negro, I did not have to compose him from an outside view. Nor did I have to write a pseudo-romantic account, as do bourgeois persons who become working-class for awhile and work in shops and factories to get material for writing dull books about workers, whose inner lives are closed to them.</p>
			<p>I created my Negro characters without sandpaper and varnish. If the Communists can create a Negro casual better than Jake in <i>Home to Harlem</i>—a man who works, lives and loves lustily and even thinks a little for himself, why in the infernal regions don't they?</p>
			<p>Jake leaves Europe for America and Harlem and swings through the Black Belt with a clean manly stride. The Communist critic states that the story of Jake was autobiographical, "dilating upon my own love life." The peeping critic seems to know more about my love life than I do myself. Perhaps it is necessary to inform him that I have not lived without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> some experience. And I have never wanted to lie about life, like the preaching black prudes wrapped up in the borrowed robes of hypocritical white respectability. I am entirely un-obsessed by sex. I am not an imitator of Anglo-Saxon prudery in writing. I haven't arrived at that high degree of civilized culture where I can make a success of producing writing carefully divorced from reality. Yet I couldn't indulge in such self-flattery as to claim Jake in <i>Home to Harlem</i> as a portrait of myself. My damned white education has robbed me of much of the primitive vitality, the pure stamina, the simple unswaggering strength of the Jakes of the Negro race.</p>
			<p>The critic declares that I "disappeared mysteriously to the Soviet Union and had retired exhausted to the sidewalk cafés of Montmartre." The statement is untrue, but perhaps truth is not vital to the new criticism that they say must replace the old.</p>
			<p>Perhaps the Communist critic, who may be closer to the sources of information than others, may have some inside knowledge of just what exhausted me in Soviet Russia. Of course, I had a hell-raising good time in Russia. I was constantly occupied in visiting factories and all kinds of institutions, making speeches and writing, besides enjoying the relaxation of cabarets and parties. Perhaps I was fatigued, as any person is likely to be after a passionate spell of any great thing. But as for my being exhausted—hell! It is fifteen years since then, and I am still going strong, if the head-in-the-butt Communist critic doesn't know. Exhausted indeed!</p>
			<p>I came out of Russia with my head on my shoulders and my pen in my pocket and determined to write at all costs, so long as I had a piece of bread to bite and a room in which I could think and scribble. And in ten years I wrote five books and many poems. Perhaps too many!</p>

			</p>
			<p>I never thought there was anything worth while for me in the bohemian glamor of Montparnasse. "The sidewalk cafés of Montmartre" held no special attraction for me. Attractive as Paris is, I have never stayed there for a considerable length of time. The longest period was over three months, when I was in a hospital. Montmartre I visited when I was invited by generous Americans who had money to treat themselves and their friends to a hectic time. The Montmartre of the cabarets and music halls never excited me. It is so obviously a place where the very formal French allow foreigners who can pay to cut up informally. It has no character of its own. Paris, away from Montmartre and Montparnasse, seemed to me to be the perfect city of modern civilization. It was the only city I knew which provided quiet and comfortable clubs in the form of cafés for all of its citizens of every class. I appreciated, but was not specially enamored of Paris, perhaps because I have never had the leisure necessary to make an excellent clubman. If I had to live in France, I would prefer life among the fisherfolk of Douarnenez, or in the city of Strassburg, or in sinister Marseilles, or any of the coast towns of the department of the Var.</p>
			<p>The Communist critic further states that I "had grown fat, and ill, and indifferent in Paris...." I regret that here I am obliged to become clinical. But the clinic is an important department of life, and the fact about it is that I got <i>well</i> instead of <i>ill</i> in Paris.</p>
			<p>In 1922 I left America in perfect health and more completely whole than the day on which I was born. My first accident of illness occurred in Russia. Sanitary conditions were not ideal in Petrograd and Moscow in 1922. No intelligent person expected them to be after eight years of unremitting international war, revolution and civil war. I remem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>ber that every time I received my linen from the laundry I invariably found lice in it. The linen itself was very clean. But the revolution, sweeping away the privileged classes, also had carried along most of their servants. And of the peasants fresh from the country who replaced them, many were neither competent nor clean.</p>
			<p>It was very near the end of my visit that I experienced a sort of deadness in my left side and once my face gradually became puffed up like an enormous chocolate soufflé. I have photographs in my possession, taken in Moscow, which authenticate my condition at the time. There was also an American acquaintance who was unable to turn his head; it was cocked stiff to one side like a macabre caricature, as if it were skewered to his shoulder. I consulted a doctor. He thought the climate had affected me and advised me to get heavy woolen underwear. Later, in Petrograd, I became quite ill and had a tooth extracted for the first time in my life, under the most painful conditions.</p>
			<p>I arrived in Germany in the early summer of 1923. Three months spent there were an interval of intermittent fevers and headaches. It was hard labor to concentrate upon a series of articles about Russia for a Negro magazine. In the late fall I arrived in Paris. I consulted a French specialist, who advised me to enter a hospital immediately. While I was convalescing in the hospital I wrote this poem, "The Desolate City." The poem was largely symbolic: a composite evocation of the clinic, my environment, condition and mood.</p>

				<i>THE DESOLATE CITY</i>

					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My spirit is a pestilential city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With misery triumphant everywhere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Glutted with baffled hopes and human pity.</span>

					<span class="pagenum">
						<a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a>

					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Strange agonies make quiet lodgement there:</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Its sewers bursting ooze up from below</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And spread their loathsome substance through its lanes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Flooding all areas with their evil flow</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And blocking all the motions of its veins:</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Its life is sealed to love or hope or pity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My spirit is a pestilential city.</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Above its walls the air is heavy-wet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Brooding in fever mood and hanging thick</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Round empty tower and broken minaret,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Settling upon the tree tops stricken sick</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And withered under its contagious breath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Their leaves are shrivelled silver, parched decay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Like wilting creepers trailing underneath</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The chalky yellow of a tropic way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Round crumbling tower and leaning minaret,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The air hangs fever-filled and heavy-wet.</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And all its many fountains no more spurt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Within the damned-up tubes they tide and foam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Around the drifted sludge and silted dirt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And weep against the soft and liquid loam.</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And so the city's ways are washed no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All is neglected and decayed within,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Clean waters beat against its high-walled shore</span>

					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The suffocated fountains cannot spurt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They foam and rage against the silted dirt.</span>

					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Beneath the ebon gloom of mounting rocks</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The little pools lie poisonously still,</span>

					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pecking at strangely gray-green substances;</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But never do they dip their bills and drink.</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They twitter, sad beneath the mournful trees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And fretfully flit to and from the brink,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In little gray-brown, green-and-purple flocks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Beneath the jet-gloom of the mounting rocks.</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And green-eyed moths of curious design,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With gold-black wings and rarely silver-dotted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On nests of flowers among those rocks recline,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bold, burning blossoms, strangely leopard-spotted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But breathing deadly poison from their lips.</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And every lovely moth that wanders by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And of the blossoms fatal nectar sips,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is doomed to drooping stupor, there to die;</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All green-eyed moths of curious design</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That on the fiercely-burning blooms recline.</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh cold as death is all the loveliness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That breathes out of the strangeness of the scene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And sickening like a skeleton's caress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of clammy clinging fingers, long and lean.</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Above it float a host of yellow flies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Circling in changeless motion in their place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That came down snow-thick from the freighted skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Swarming across the gluey floor of space:</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh cold as death is all the loveliness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And sickening like a skeleton's caress.</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There was a time, when, happy with the birds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The little children clapped their hands and laughed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And midst the clouds the glad winds heard their words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="pagenum">
						<a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a>

					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And blew down all the merry ways to waft</span>

					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The music through the scented fields of flowers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh sweet were children's voices in those days,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Before the fall of pestilential showers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That drove them forth far from the city's ways:</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Now never, nevermore their silver words</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Will mingle with the golden of the birds.</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gone, gone forever the familiar forms</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To which the city once so dearly clung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Blown worlds beyond by the destroying storms</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And lost away like lovely songs unsung.</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yet life still lingers, questioningly strange,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Timid and quivering, naked and alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Against the cycle of disruptive change,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Though all the fond familiar forms are gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Forever gone, the fond familiar forms;</span>
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Blown worlds beyond by the destroying storms.</span>

			<p>More than three years after "The Desolate City" was written, it was published for the first time in the Negro magazine, <i>Opportunity</i>. But by then I was a stout black animal, splashing and floating in the blue Mediterranean. The French specialist had said: "You are young, with a very wonderful constitution, and you will recover all right if you will live quietly and carefully away from the temptations of the big cities." I certainly did follow that good advice.</p>
